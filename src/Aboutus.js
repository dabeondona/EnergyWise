            The story starts in 2005, when The Streisand Company, a consulting
            firm founded by Dave Ondona, provided solutions to the ever-growing
            problems in the Energy Industry. Over the years, their innovative
            approaches and sustainable solutions made them a beacon in the
            sector. By 2015, Streisand had established itself as one of the
            premier consulting businesses in the country.

          <p className="as-streisand">
            As Streisand celebrated its decade of success, Dave Ondona realized
            that while they had been instrumental in transforming large-scale
            energy operations, there was a significant portion of the market
            they hadn't touched – the homeowners and small businesses. Motivated
            by this new vision, The company founder embarked on a journey to
            adapt their expertise for a more diverse clientele.
